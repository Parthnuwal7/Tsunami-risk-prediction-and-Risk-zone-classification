# Tsunami-risk-prediction-and-Risk-zone-classification
In this project, we aim to assess high-risk earthquake zones,  examine the correlation between tsunami risks and  seismic parameters, and develop predictive models for  community impact using a dataset of high magnitude earthquakes from 1995- 2023
